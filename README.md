# Fairly Fast Fluids

This repository contains a browser-based, 2D, GPU fluid simulation using the `regl` library for WebGL. The implementation of the fluid simulation is a modified version of the techniques described by [GPU Gems, Chapter 38: Fast Fluid Dynamics Simulation on the GPU](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/books/HTML/gpugems/gpugems_ch38.html), with additional references to Jamie Wong's [Fluid Simulation (with WebGL)](http://jamie-wong.com/2016/08/05/webgl-fluid-simulation/#solving-for-pressure) article, and Pavel Dobryakov's [WebGL Fluid Simulation](https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation) repository.
